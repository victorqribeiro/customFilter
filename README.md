## About

As the name suggests, this project came about after some experiments running custom [filters](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/cvweb/tutorial1.html)
on images. The next best thing this editor allows you to do is to run custom [blend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes) equations on multiple
images at once.

## Videos

Here are some videos on the editor features and how to use them.
